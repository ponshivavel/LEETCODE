PRACTICE THE LINKED LIST....

LINKED LIST->collection of element (Node)connected in chain
each not contains DATA->value stored in node
                  NEXT->referecemto the next node in the list


                  [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> null
Why Use a Linked List?
Dynamic Size: You can easily  shrink a Linked List without worrying about memory (unlike arrays, which have a fixed size).
Easy Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements is efficient because you donâ€™t have to move all elements like in an array.
